# P1 Recipe Recommender

# Run / Install
We have been victims to the famous saying 'it works on my machine'. 
To fix that, we recommend running it using Docker. 
Docker can be downloaded here [link](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). 
Once Docker is installed, make sure that the Docker daemon is running in the background. 
Open your terminal and type the following:
docker run -it --rm many5900/p1:v6
