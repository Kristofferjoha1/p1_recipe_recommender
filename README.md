# P1 Recipe Recommender

# Run / Install
We have been victims to the famous saying 'it works on my machine'. <br>
To fix that, we recommend running it using Docker. <br>
Docker can be downloaded here [link](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). <br>
Once Docker is installed, make sure that the Docker daemon is running in the background. <br>
Open your terminal and type the following: <br>
`docker run -it --rm many5900/p1:v6`
